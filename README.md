# saving_users_to_cloud_storage_with_User_Management

This is a simple web page that allows users to manage appointments with basic user details. It's built with HTML, Bootstrap for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic functionality. Users can add, edit, and delete appointments. Here's what the code includes:

A form to input user details, including name, email, and phone number.
Upon form submission, the user details are sent to a server (using Axios for HTTP requests) and added to a list of appointments.
Users can view a list of appointments with associated "Edit" and "Delete" buttons.
The "Edit" button allows users to modify existing appointments.
The "Delete" button lets users remove an appointment.
All data is stored in an external API (crudcrud.com) for persistence.
